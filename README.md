# Laravel Malware Validation Rule

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/DivineOmega/laravel-malware-validation-rule.svg?token=rFpfMqmDynvcy8vZ7axT&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/DivineOmega/laravel-malware-validation-rule)

The Laravel Malware Validation Rule package provides a validation rule that
scans uploaded files for viruses and other malware.

## Installation

To install the Laravel Malware Validation Rule package, run the following command

```bash
composer require divineomega/laravel-malware-validation-rule
```

This package makes use of the ClamAV daemon to perform virus/malware scanning. You can 
install ClamAV in Ubuntu/Debian with the following command.

```bash
sudo apt install clamav-daemon
```

Your ClamAV installation should automatically update virus defintions. However, you can 
update your ClamAV virus definitions manually using the `freshclam` command. 
It is recommended to restart the ClamAV daemon after the virus definitions have
been updated to ensure they take effect.

```bash
sudo freshclam
sudo service clamav-daemon restart
```

## Usage

See the following basic usage example, which demonstrates how to validate a basic
file upload does not contain contain a known virus/malware.

```php
use \DivineOmega\LaravelMalwareValidationRule\Rules\Malware;

// ...

public function rules()
{
    return [
        'my_file' => ['required', 'file', new Malware()],
    ];
}
```

By default the validation rule message will include the name of the detected 
virus/malware. If you do not wish the malware name to be shown in the 
validation message you can turn this off as shown below.

```php
public function rules()
{
    $showMalwareName = false;

    return [
        'my_file' => ['required', 'file', new Malware($showMalwareName)],
    ];
}
```
